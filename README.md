Propagate BOM property
======================

OpenERP custom module to provide extra functionality on BOM property

The orginal BOM property can only work with the product BOM itself or another
word, first level of a BOM.

This module will allow the BOM property propagate through the BOM structure
in the process of BOM exploading. Thus, the BOM property set on the
componenent BOM can also be checked to decide which BOM to use for a componenent.
